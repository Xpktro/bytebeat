# bytebeat.sh
A small bash script for listeting to and saving [bytebeats](https://creators.vice.com/en_us/article/qkzakx/meet-bytebeat-a-brand-new-electronic-music-genre).

# Requirements
_Note: This has been tested and written in OSX, linux support can be done with little or no changes. PRs are always welcome._

For this script to work you must install (besides bash which is already included in your OS):

- [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/)
- [SoX](http://sox.sourceforge.net/)

Installation will vary depending on your OS but it should be pretty simple. Check for [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) in OSX or your favorite linux package manager, they should include ready-made packages for both dependencies.

# Installation
Once you downloaded and installed the dependencies, just clone this repo and/or download/copy the `bytebeat.sh` file in whatever folder you have write permissions for :)

# Usage
Executing `bytebeat.sh` without any argument will show its help message.

For listening to a bytebeat, just pass its formula to the script:
```
./bytebeat.sh "(t%255&t)-(t>>13&t)"
```
_Note: currently nothing more than t (the time-changing variable) and the usual aritmethic/bitwise operations are supported._

If you want to save your bytebeat to a file, use the `-e|--export` option.
```
./bytebeat.sh "(t%255&t)-(t>>13&t)" --export
```

By default it will use `output.wav` as the name for the resulting sound file. You can specify this name using the `-f|--filename` option.
```
./bytebeat.sh "(t%255&t)-(t>>13&t)" --export -f bytebeat.wav
```

Exported files will contain 10 seconds of audio by default. You can change this audio length by using the `-d|--duration` option.
```
./bytebeat.sh "(t%255&t)-(t>>13&t)" --export -f bytebeat.wav --duration 5
```
